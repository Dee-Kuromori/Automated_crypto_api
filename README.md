# Automated_crypto_api


The purpose of this project was to automate the process of get request from api of crypto currencey, saving it to pandas dataframes, and saving/appending one of those dataframes to csv file. After saving the data to
dataframes and csv file, I performed some aggregations, calculations, and vizualizations using python seaborn module.
